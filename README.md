# ESP32 project manager for Visual Studio Code

Extension that allows its users to build, flash and monitor ESP32 projects based on the ESP-IDF.

----------

## Features

- Standard project structure for the use of this extension.\
This project structure allows the use of more than one application programs or 'sub-projects' that may have more than one entry point.\
The project structure is as follows:

>project (Project folder)

>- Makefile (ESP32 Makefile file) [Tracked by Git]
>- sdkconfig.defaults (ESP32 default config values file) [Tracked by Git]

### Supported OS

- Windows

### Commands

- `ESP32-PM: Register ESP-IDF API` : Register the path of a folder that contains an ESP-IDF API. [**Windows**]
- `ESP32-PM: Register Espressif Toolchain` : Register the path of a folder that contains an Espressif Toolchain. [**Windows**]
- `ESP32-PM: Create project` : Create a new ESP32 project. [**Windows**]
- `ESP32-PM: Initialize exisiting project` : Initialize an existing ESP32 project. [**Windows**]
- `ESP32-PM: Menuconfig` : Run the `make menuconfig` command, which shows the configuration interface for a ESP32 project. [**Windows**]
- `ESP32-PM: Defconfig` : Run the `make defconfig` command, which applies the default configuration values defined in the `sdkconfig.defaults` file. [**Windows**]
- `ESP32-PM: Build sub-project` : Run the `make -j all` command, which builds the previously selected sub-project source. [**Windows**]

## Requirements

### For Windows

The following elements are required to be previously installed:

1. The [Espressif Toolchain](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/esp32_win32_msys2_environment_and_toolchain-20190611.zip) (the 'msys32' folder) unzziped in a folder located in a path with no spaces.
2. The ESP-IDF by cloning [its repository](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) recursively (git clone --recursive \<repo\>) in a folder located in a path with no spaces. You could use any version.

----------

## Usage

After meeting the requirements and installing this extension, you could follow the steps below:

### First of all:
- Register a ESP-IDF folder with the `ESP32-PM: Register ESP-IDF API` command.
- Register a Espressif Toolchain folder with the `ESP32-PM: Register Espressif Toolchain` command.

### Create a new project:
- Create a new project with the `ESP32-PM: Create project`.

### Initialize an existing project:
- Initialize the existent project with the `ESP32-PM: Initialize exisiting project`.
**NOTE:** Keep in mind that this command will suffix some files listed in a warning.

### Build, flash, monitor and clean regular `make` commands:
These commands are often used with ESP32 projects based on GNU Make. They can be used with their corresponding extension command.
